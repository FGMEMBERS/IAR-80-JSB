Hello, and thank you for flying this aircraft.
I can only hope that it meets your expectations :).

###########################################################################################################
This is the first "stable" release, as I consider I have implemented enough functions and features to the aircraft
for it to get that status.

Please read the AUTHORS file for credit
to people whose code I used/inspired from in developing this aircraft.

Also PLEASE read the TODO file to get a rough impression of things
that are currently missing or poorly implemented.

You'll find a quick cockpit reference in the doc folder as some instruments are not that obvious,
or are marked in Romanian/German
and some of the levers never had any labels to identify them.

QUICK AND DIRTY START-up AND TAKEOFF GUIDE:

WARNING:
	Throttle is reversed in this version, as it was on the original planes. (Helicopter pilots may rejoice :P)
  Keep Oil temperature below 120 (the engine will start choking and will eventualy seize).
  Keep Revs below 2800, except for take-off andemergency situations. (the engine will start choking and will eventualy stop).
  There is increased wear over 3000 revs.
  Keep boost pressure below 950, except for short time in take-off/emergenecy situations.
  Also as an indicator of pronounced engine wear, dark smoke will come out of the exhaust.


START-up:

1:	turn master switch on (the big hexagonal button over the pilot's right shoulder).
2:	set mixture to rich (lever at forward position).
3:	set some throttle.
4:	prime 6-9 times.
5:	set prop-pitch at about half.
6:	set magnetos to M1+2.
7:	open the cowl-flaps ("r" key).
8:	engage starter button until oil-pressure (the left half, marked M, on the combined oil-fuel pressure gauge) starts to increase.

* If it doesn't start.. check that the fuel pressure rises when engaging starter, if it doesn't prime it some more.. :)

WARM-up:
1.	set prop-pitch for minimum revs (towards the rear)
2.	add some throttle until boost pressure reaches ~400 (engine rpm will stabilise at about 1450-1500)
3.	wait until oil pressure gets over 1 and oil-temp reaches about 60

TAXI:
1:	set prop pitch towards half.
2:	adjust the seat position in order to see more in front of the aircraft.
2:	you have to use the differential brakes, as there was just a tail-skid.

TAKE OFF:
a:	adjust the seat height to the minimum.
b: 	close canopy.
1:	set prop pitch so that the pitch indicator forms a small V around 12 'o clock.
2: 	release brakes and be prepared to correct the aircraft's tendency to yaw to the right
			      (either by braking (at low speeds) or by using opposite rudder).
3:	set throttle to have about 950-1000 boost pressure.
4: 	maintain a little back pressure on the stick until the tail lifts off the ground.
5: 	maintain little back pressure (just enough to keep the plane level)
		until about 150-160km/h when the plane should take off by itself.
6: 	raise gear.

SHORT FIELD TAKE OFF:
On short fields the T/O procedure differs a bit. You need to set flaps to position 2, then hold
the brakes untill the engine revs up, with throttle set for ~1000 boost pressure.
Only after the engine has reached ~3000RPM release the brakes.


CRUISE SETTING:
1:	set prop pitch so that the needles of the indicator form a V around the 11:05 position.
2:	set mixture lever at about the apex of the bend in the lever guard. (~0.6 - 0.7 mixture).
3:	cowl flaps at position 2/8.

LANDING:

1:	reduce throttle.
2:	open cowl flaps.
3:	at about 300 km/h start extending full flaps.
4:	below 250 km/h extend gear.
5:	touchdown at 150 km/h.
6:	keep back pressure on the stick to keep the tail down and apply gentle pressure on the brakes.

EMERGENCY:
    If you lose the engine during flight the hydraulic system loses presurisation making it inoperable.
    Although flaps and brakes become inoperable there is an emergency landing gear deployment procedure that you can use:
1:	set the gear safety knob to the safe position
2:	check the air pressure gauge
3:	there needs to be enough air pressure for gear deployment (>70)
4:	if air pressure is too low, pump using the manual pump on the right of the cockpit
5:	check airspeed below 250 kph.
6:	release the gear emergency lever on your left side.
7:	check gear down and locked as indicated by the gear indicator.

LIMITS:
1:	Maximum flap extension airspeed - 300 kph (if exceded flaps jam, can be reset by the failure manager)
2: 	Maximum gear extension airspeed - 250 kph (if exceded gear will jam, can be reset by the failure manager)
3:	Vne 750 kph IAS. (if exceded aileron/elevator/rudder will tear off, depending on their position, can be reset by the failure manager)
4:	Maximum g-load - 7G. (if exceded the wing will bend, resulting in bad aerodinamic performance, can be reset by the IAR80 menu)
5:	Maximum negative g-load - 4G.(if exceded same as #4 above)

GUNS AND MG-s ARMING:
By default the weapons are not armed. If you desire you might set their corresponding switches to your pleasure.
